# Microscopic Simulation
The purpose of the simulation is to teach how to quantify the concentration of unicellular algae in a solution. It replicates the conditions of a real microscope to provide a realistic and effective learning experience.

## How it was made
This game was made entirely by me in tree days, using only Unity and C#.

## What I implemented
The game is really simple, so the only features I implemented are camera movement and zoom levels.
